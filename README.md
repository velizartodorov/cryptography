# cryptographyStreamHillCipher

C++ source code encrypting plain text consequently in Stream and Hill Cipher. The cyphertext is displayed via console.

# Source Code

The source code is developed using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express. Besides the algorithm, which encrypts the plain text, additional user features are also included — messages for typing the plain text using only lowercase latin letters and proper key input for the Stream cipher. Two main functions for every cipher are included, both parameterized - output parameter of the first cipher becomes input for the second. All methods, which are used several times, are also parameterized. The console output is develope in presentation form — using the Enter key every program module is visualised consequently.
